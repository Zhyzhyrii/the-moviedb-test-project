            &quot;overview&quot;: &quot;Texan Charles Farmer left the Air Force as a young man to save the family ranch when his dad died. Like most American ranchers, he owes his bank. Unlike most, he&#39;s an astrophysicist with a rocket in his barn - one he&#39;s built and wants to take into space. It&#39;s his dream. The FBI puts him under surveillance when he tries to buy rocket fuel, and the FAA stalls him when he files a flight plan – but Charles is undeterred.&quot;,
