Until now, the run-down apartment block has been considered untouchable to even the bravest of police. Cloaked under the cover of pre-dawn darkness and silence, an elite swat team is tasked with raiding the safe house in order to take down the notorious drug lord that runs it.  But when a chance encounter with a spotter blows their cover and news of their assault reaches the drug lord, the building&#39;s lights are cut and all the exits blocked. Stranded on the sixth floor with no way out, the unit must fight their way through the city&#39;s worst to survive their mission. Starring Indonesian martial arts sensation Iko Uwais.&quot;,

            &quot;overview&quot;: &quot;In this riot of frantic disguises and mistaken identities, Victor Pivert, a blustering, bigoted French factory owner, finds himself taken hostage by Slimane, an Arab rebel leader. The two dress up as rabbis as they try to elude not only assasins from Slimane&#39;s country, but also the police, who think Pivert is a murderer. Pivert ends up posing as Rabbi Jacob, a beloved figure who&#39;s returned to France for his first visit after 30 years in the United States. Adding to the confusion are Pivert&#39;s dentist-wife, who thinks her husband is leaving her for another woman, their daughter, who&#39;s about to get married, and a Parisian neighborhood filled with people eager to celebrate the return of Rabbi Jacob.&quot;,
