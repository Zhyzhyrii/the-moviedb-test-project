            &quot;overview&quot;: &quot;Moonwalker is a 1988 American experimental anthology musical film starring Michael Jackson. Rather than featuring one continuous narrative, the film expresses the influence of fandom and innocence through a collection of short films about Jackson, some of which are long-form music videos from Jackson&#39;s 1987 album Bad. The film is named after his famous dance, \&quot;the moonwalk\&quot;, which he originally learned as \&quot;the backslide\&quot; but perfected the dance into something no one had seen before. The movie&#39;s introduction is a type of music video for Jackson&#39;s \&quot;Man in the Mirror\&quot; but is not the official video for the song. The film then expresses a montage of Michael&#39;s career, which leads into a parody of his Bad video titled \&quot;Badder\&quot;, followed by sections \&quot;Speed Demon\&quot; and \&quot;Leave Me Alone\&quot;. What follows is the biggest section where Michael plays a hero with magical powers and saves three children from Mr. Big. This section is \&quot;Smooth Criminal\&quot; which leads into a performance of \&quot;Come Together\&quot;.&quot;,
